## Intro

A simple script which can parse plain text into vocabulary frequency usage. 

(WIP)

for now it only works on Mac OS.

## Usage

```sh
python3 calc.py book.txt
```

And you will get an estimate report of how you understand a book.


## Roadmap

* Integrate a practicable parser.
* Add japanese Language support.
